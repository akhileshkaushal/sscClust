Title: simpler single cell RNAseq data clustering
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xianwen Ren, Liangtao Zheng
Maintainer: Liangtao Zheng <tao2013@gmail.com>
Description: A package implement mutilple functionalities which are commonly used in single cell RNAseq data analysis, 
    including variable genes identification, dimension reduction, clustering on reduced data. Currently, this package also 
    wrap other clustering method designed specifically for single cell RNAseq data, including SC3, ZinbWave etc. In addition, 
    some new ideas were proposed, such as projecting data to a feature space using spearman correlation which make 
    visualiaztion and clustering more efficient, clustering with subsampling and classfification which make it feasible to 
    process thousands cells' data.
